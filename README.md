#### By Sally Alvarenga ðŸŒº,

## Task and Expectation
In this assignment I was expected to create a timed coding quiz in which I would be able to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The User is expected to be able to load my quiz and click a start button to start the timed quiz. The questions are expected to appear one at a time with each user selection of a possible answer choice. If the use chooses an incorrect answer, time is expected to be deducted from the timer. And when the game is over the user expects to be able to see they're score, based on how many questions they answered correctly.The user should also be able to save the name onto a leader Board.


## Results
You can View my Deployed Portfolio Here: https://salvarenga74.github.io/Portfolio_HW_02/

I met the accepted criteria of this assignment and have gone beyond (in my opinion) to create a beautiful portfolio page that is a reflection of my potential as a developer and my work ethic. It contains 2 current photos of myself, has a section that describes the other applications I have deployed, contains a section with some background about myself, and gives my contact information.

My Portfolio has a functioning Navigation Bar that jump down to the desired section within the webpage.  

It also shows the advanced CSS that was expected such as growing sections when the user hovers over them, links on images that deploy to live websites, and a responsive layout that changed based on the screen view.
