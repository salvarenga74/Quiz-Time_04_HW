## Task and Expectation
In this assignment I was expected to create a timed coding quiz in which I would be able to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The User is expected to be able to load my quiz and click a start button to start the timed quiz. The questions are expected to appear one at a time with each user selection of a possible answer choice. If the use chooses an incorrect answer, time is expected to be deducted from the timer. And when the game is over the user expects to be able to see they're score, based on how many questions they answered correctly.The user should also be able to save the name onto a leader Board.


## Results

I met the accepted criteria of this assignment and have created clean user interface for a simple quiz. My quiz features a start button that allows the user to view the questions and to begin the timed portion of the quiz. 

Upon viewing the first question, the use is able to select any of the answer choices and the next question will appear. The time remaining for the quiz is decrease by 2 seconds each time the user selects a wrong answer until time reaches 0. 

When the timer reaches 0 or when the user has answered all 5 questions (depending on which event comes first) the quiz will end and the user will see their score. The score is based only on the amount of questions the user answered correctly, each question is worth 1 point. 

Additionally, the summary page has the option to take in a user's name and store it as local storage so that the user can see their name on the High Score List.
